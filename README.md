### Traditional Scottish recipe

This is a traditional recipe for Scottish shortbread handed down from my great-grandfather, who was a baker in England. The shortbread is **best eaten after** storing it for about **a month**.

- Simple and tasty.
- Goes well with tea.
- Tastes better stale than freshly baked!
